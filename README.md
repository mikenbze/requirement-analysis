# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The purpose of this stage is to gather, clarify, and document the functional and non-functional requirements of the software so that developers, designers, and stakeholders have a clear, shared vision. This process helps prevent misunderstandings, reduces costly rework, scope creep and ensures that the final product solves the right problem effectively.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of users and stakeholders for a software system. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for designing, building, testing, and deploying a product that meets user needs and business goals.

## ðŸ§© What Does Requirement Analysis Involve?
### Gathering Requirements
    â€“ Interviewing stakeholders
    â€“ Distributing questionnaires
    â€“ Observing user environments
    â€“ Reviewing existing systems

### Analyzing Requirements
    â€“ Ensuring requirements are complete, consistent, and realistic
    â€“ Identifying potential risks, gaps, or conflicts
    â€“ Prioritizing features and constraints

### Documenting Requirements
    â€“ Creating clear and formal documentation like SRS (Software Requirements Specification)
    â€“ Including both functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (performance, security, usability) requirements

### Validating and Reviewing
    â€“ Getting stakeholder sign-off
    â€“ Using models like use case diagrams, user stories, or wireframes to validate understanding

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
### âœ… 1. Ensures Project Clarity and Direction
It defines what is to be built and aligns the development team with the clientâ€™s vision.
### âœ… 2. Reduces Risks and Costly Rework
Clear requirements prevent misunderstandings and reduce the chances of developing incorrect or incomplete features.
### âœ… 3. Improves Time and Resource Management
With well-defined requirements, project managers can better estimate timelines, costs, and allocate resources efficiently.
### âœ… 4. Supports Better Design and Development
Requirements serve as the blueprint that developers and designers follow throughout the SDLC.
### âœ… 5. Enhances Communication
It creates a common language between technical teams and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

## ðŸŒ€ Role of Requirement Analysis in the SDLC Stages
| SDLC Stage  | Role of Requirement Analysis                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Planning    | Defines scope and feasibility of the project              |
| Design      | Provides input for system architecture and UI/UX design   |
| Development | Guides developers on what features to build               |
| Testing     | Helps QA teams create test cases to validate requirements |
| Deployment  | Ensures the final product meets the intended purpose      |
| Maintenance | Identifies additional requirements for future updates     |
